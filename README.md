# MandesCDA

This repository contains an event-based Java framework for building agent-based models (ABM) of a continuous double auction (CDA) financial market.

The proposed framework allows for a proper implementation of the time dimension, contributing to correctly mixing trading strategies which are active at different temporal-frequencies (e.g., low- and high-frequency strategies).

Moreover two implementations, corresponding to the following publications, are provided:
